## Custom Chat Gpt

*   A web app that uses the OpenAI ChatGPT API to get query results from users.
*   Users can choose the field of information they need before submitting their query.
*   For example, if a user selects the medical field, a custom prompt for that field will be created and appended to the user's query.
*   This will help to give the user the best possible output for their query.
